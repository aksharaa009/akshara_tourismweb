        <p class="card-text">Built by the first Portuguese Viceroy in India, Don Francesco de Almeida (1505), St. Angelo’s Fort is among the most historic sites in Kannur. This massive triangular laterite structure is flanked by gigantic bastions that make for an imposing sight. It changed hands between the Dutch and eventually the British, who would remodel and reequip it into their primary military stronghold in Malabar.

        <h5 class="card-title">Paithalmala </h5>
        <p class="card-text"> Paithalmala is one of the most amazing tourist destinations in the district of Kannur. Nestled in the Western Ghats, the hill station looks over the Coorg valleys on one side and the plains of Kannur on the other. From the crest, if the fog lifts a little, you’d see tiny matchbox-sized houses in villages far down the valley.The trail uphill is not arduous for a seasoned trekker. Where the forest teeters to a halt, the vast grassland takes over. It is about 5 km trekking through the semi-evergreen shola forests to reach the top. </p>

        <p class="card-text">Muzhappilangad Beach is famous for being Kerala's only drive-in beach. At about 7km from Thalassery in Kannur, you have a 4 km stretch of sand that awaits you to simply drive along as you soak in the view of the beautiful Malabar Coast. Along the way, one gets to munch on delicacies from a number of shacks that offer authentic Malabar cuisine. It is often considered a swimmers paradise as the black rocks protect the beach from deep currents. This is a perfect way to relax and soak in this clean and well maintained beach. </p>
